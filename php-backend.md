Goals
-----

1. Development - Code-base scalability: Managing growing code-bases → writing modular code, promoting loose coupling, using standard software patterns
2. Development - Code-base re-usability: Making software components re-usable → writing modular code, writing documentation
3. Development - Code-base maintainability: Making code maintainable and revieable → Using standard coding conventions, writing documentation
4. Development - Team-size scalability: Working in large teams → Using version control systems, utilizing branching strategies
5. Development - Interoperability: Making systems that easily interoperate with others → Using industry standards
6. Modern technologies: Staying up-to date
7. Runtime - Load scalability: Performance-wise scalable systems → Determining appropriate architectures, utilizing caches/databases/algorithms

UML
---

1. What is UML?
2. What UML diagram would you use for the following?

   “The client sends a request to the Webserver. The Webserver makes a query to the database. After receiving the database response, the Webserver processes the results. Finally, the Webserver responds to the client”
3. What UML diagram would you use for the following?

   “First you initialize the sum variable to zero. Then you loop through all elements of the input array. For each element, you add the element's price to the sum variable. At the end, you print the sum variable.”
4. What UML diagram would you use for the following?

   “When a payment transaction is created, it's said to be in “CREATED” state. From this state, it can either be accepted or rejected by the administrator. If it's accepted, its state becomes “ACCEPTED”, otherwise it becomes “REJECTED”.”
5. What UML diagram would you use for the following?

   “The system will consist of a MySQL database which is connected to an Apache Webserver, running our PHP Web Service. The PHP Web Service is then accessible from the HTML5 Web Application and the Mobile Applications over HTTPS”

Yii Framework
